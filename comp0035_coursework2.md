# Coursework 2

Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.

## Requirements definition and analysis
The term 'requirements' is used in the broader sense, user stories and/or use cases may be used.
### Requirements identification methods
The two main methods I will use to identify requirements are an interview and brainstorming. The reason for using an interview is beacuse of the methodology used, which is crisp-DM. Crisp-DM starts with having a business understanding. An interview with the target audience (in this case, a cinema CEO) is a very good way to understand how the business works and will give us a good starting point in creating requirements that would be useful to the target audience. Also because cinema CEOs pretty much have the same target and goals, this means that a few interviews can be generalised for the all CEOs and this would be beneficial as it would save time and money. Brainstorming is the other method used to identify requirements. Brainstorming helps us to find additional requirements by coming up with similar ideas that we found from the responses of the interviews.
### Requirement specification method
